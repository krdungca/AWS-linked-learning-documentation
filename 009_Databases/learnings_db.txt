1. created free-tier RDS DB, mySQL
	1a. created snapshot of the current RDS DB
2. RDS deployments:
	2a. Read Replica (max 15 replica), replica can read to app, but only main can be writted by app
	2b. Multi-AZ (max 1 cross-az), failover in case of issues
	2c. Multi-Region (cross region), apps in other region can only write to the main RDS (not the replica)
3. created dynamoDB table in ap-southeast-1
	3a. created partition key
	3b. created attributes 
	3c. conducted a simple query by using the partition key values
4. other db and analytics:
	4a. dynamodb acceleration (DAX) - inmem cache
	4b. redshift (postgre) - for OLAP (analysis,columnar), not OLTP (transcations where relationdal db is better)
	4c. EMR - elastic Map Reduce - for big data (Hadoop cluster), clusters of hundreds of EC2 instances
	4d. Athena - s3 data analysis using SQL to query CSV, JSON, AVRO, Parquet
	4e. Quicksight - serverless ML-powered BI, quick dashboard, ad-hoc changes
	4f. DocumentDB - mongoDB noSQL, similar deployment as Aurora
	4g. Neptune - for graphSQL, social networks, knowledge graphs (Wikipedia)
	4h. Timestream - time-based data
	4i. Managed Blockchain - decentralized transactions, hyperedge R fabric, Ethereum
	4j. Glue - extract transform load (ETL) service, multi-source, can be linked to redshift for analytics
	4k. DMS - database managed service - multidatabase migrations, allows active database migration (without shutting down source)
		4k.1. Homogenous - same
		4k.2. Heterogenous - different
